# Iris-machine-learning 
Use of machine learning with decision trees based on mean, median and quantiles with the Iris species set.

The first file of the series uses the indicator median with a split of 80/20, which includes all the explanations, that are used in the other notebooks.

The two excel files include a list of all the results from the Gini Indexes calculations, the decision trees for each species and indicator and the efficiencies of each tree. It also has a couple of plotly graphs for species distribution using sepals and petals.
The csv has the efficiencies of the trees, in order to make further comparisons on which indicator and split would be the best for species classification purposes.
